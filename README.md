# SchoolProjects
A few school-related and personal projects of mine completed during my time at UTK. These include C++/C programs for computer science classes, VHDL projects for the BASYS3 FPGA development board, IEEE format lab reports for electronics classes, and more.

The purpose of this public repository is for potential employers or casual observers to observe much of my work conveniently in one location. I hold no copyrights on any of my code or projects.
