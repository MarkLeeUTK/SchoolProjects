In this folder I showcase my VHDL projects from ECE 357, Honors Digital Design (Fall 2019). For each project I include the lab report which has most of the details on the specifics of the project, and most of the code.

I make no guarantees on the completeness of the code included for any individual project - I completed these assignments a while back, so some files might have gotten lost in transistion. However, most of the main code is included, so an observer should be able to fill in the missing pieces.
